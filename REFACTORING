disable copying and moving for classes not predicted for copying or moving if owning resources

consider creating wrappers for managed resources in case of exeption in during construction

TODO:
consider using unique_ptr with custom deleter instead of LoadedSDLsurface wrapper
or simply freeing surface before throwing exeption

TODO:
try to change pointer arguments to reference arguments where possible

TODO:
consider replacing most of the pointers with shared::ptr and weak_ptr where applicable

try to inline possible operations

make conditionaly compilied debugging code

make movable object base class and derive ball, paddle and block

simplify game constructor

try to replace Renderer::SetBall, Renderer::SetPaddle and similar to one setting all objects to display

TODO: change all parammeters to cammelCase

TODO: consider making pointer to paddle a member of class game

TODO: remove StaticObject if not needed

TODO: consider setting \_texture in objects to a pointer and allow for validation check in the constructor

TODO: for all Set functions like in SetBall or SetWalls in Renderer consider adding check for invariants

TODO: clean CMakeLists.txt

TODO: check where in paddle stored height and half height allow for sparing calculations.
Apply the same to other classes if possible

TODO: consider changing angles where reasonable to integers for simplifing calculations

TODO: consider resignation from paddle vertical movement

TODO: use inheritance in game::update, draw() and similar if posiible

TODO: in Game create objects functions there are many constructors where perhaps float position arguments
instead of in might be better

TODO: find a right place to reserve place for static objects in renderer and game

TODO: consider changing paddle refernce to pointer in ball and reduce constructor (pointer could be set after paddle creation)

TODO: consider simplyfing condition checks in direction determining (lik 0 < x < 90>)

TODO: consider making consts with assests names

TODO: consider putting all enums in one file

TODO: check all classes for leaking resources

TODO: consider making seperate file with crucial consts or putting static conts in classes were reasonable
